
# Case Study of Robo-Advisory platform, Betterment

## Overview and Origin

Betterment is an online robo advisor company created to make investment accessible to the wider audience. Automation and portfolios that are tailored around individual goals is at the heart of the company. Algorithms and mathematical rules are the basis of the financial advices for the customer.

Betterment is one of the pioneers of robo-advisory services. Betterment was established in 2008 in New York City by Jon Stein, MBA graduate from Colombia University, and his google software engineer roommate Sean Owen. The idea behind creating the company was to make the overly complicated and expensive field of investing be accessible to everyone. In 2010, the company was recognized with the award of Biggest New York disrupter at TechCrunch disrupt New York. More than a decade later, Betterment is still among the most widely held robo-advisory service platforms leading the increasing crowd of robo advisory platform options.

Betterment first significant batch of venture capital financing (series A financing or investment) came from Bessemer Venture Partners in 2010. Series B finance funding came from Menlo Ventures, Anthemis Group and Bessemer Venture Partners.

## Business Activities:

The main idea behind the advent of robo-advisors is to crack down the bureaucratic complexity and reduce the expense of services that was making the field of investing unreachable for most people. They are intended to democratize the field of investing by lowering cost, lowering or eliminating the minimum amount requirement that was holding the younger generation from taking part in.

Currently, the company has more than 500,000 customers and it is managing 21 Billion assets under management. Betterment target customers are the younger generation. The customer base data obtained from the company shows average age of Betterment customers is 35, and about two-thirds of the customers are millennials. The targeted market strategy makes sense on the basis that automated investing is new, and millennials tend to be early adopters of new technology. Even though the company has a target audience, the platform is open to any age group. The benefit from the use of advanced technology in the area of finance should be accessible to every age group.

Pros and cons of Betterment:

Pros:

- Betterment provides a much lower operating fees than the investment advisors that do business in the traditional sense
- Betterment abolished the minimum balances requirement that put investment out of reach to the younger generation who is just being introduced to the field of investing.
- Algorithms used in the investment decisions are based on well-established economic theories and financial advice that uses low-cost passive index funds
- Availability of different portfolios to choose from for different goals. In addition to the default portfolio recommendations, Betterment differentiates itself from competitors by offering custom portfolio that a customer can choose from:

  - Socially Responsible Investing option: invests in ETFs tracking benchmark that filters out companies on the basis of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors.
  - Goldman Sachs Smart Beta option: utilizes alternative diversification strategies to try to earn outsized returns while keeping costs low.
  - BlackRock Target Income option: diversified bond fund for investors who want to generate a steady stream of income.

  - Flexible Portfolio option: the asset class weightings offered can be adjusted to the customer in the default Betterment Portfolio.
  - Provision of tax management features which includes tax-loss harvesting. Tax-loss harvesting is a method of rebalancing your portfolio holdings to limit capital gains taxes.

Cons:

- Professional one to one advice with an advisor is expensive
- The emergency fund investment portfolio scheme appears to be risky
- For the custom portfolio options, the expense ratio fee is very high
- The choices presented at the beginning (for beginners) could be overwhelming

Betterment has also changed the cash management landscape and has automated cash flows into the various accounts of the customer. The system/algorithm does cash analysis of the customer&#39;s checking account and predicts the amount of cash needed for a month plus five days based on the historical use data of the customer. It maintains the predicted amount of money in checking account and sweeps all the rest into savings. If there is an emergent need for extra cash, it automatically puts back some money into checking. This autopilot and smart automation that gives the customer a peace of mind will be one of the drivers of future financial services.

The company uses the customer&#39;s income level, portfolio goal and age to gauge and synthesize risk appetite/tolerance. Betterment&#39;s algorithms match your risk tolerance and specific goals to diversified portfolios of low-cost exchange traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds.

Betterment provides two service tiers:

- The basic tier of service, Betterment Digital, is available for all customers, regardless of their account balances.
  - Advisory fee: 0.25%
  - Professional advice: $199 for a 45-minute call with a CFP that&#39;ll get you started with Betterment; $299 for a 60-minute call with a CFP for help with other goals, such as saving for college or a financial checkup.
- Customers with account balances of at least $100,000 can opt in to the Betterment Premium tier of service, for unlimited talks with Betterment&#39;s financial advisors.
  - Advisory fee: 0.40%
  - Professional advice: Unlimited, free consultations with Betterment investment professionals.

The company makes use of advanced technology to stay competitive. Some of the technologies in use include Big Data, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to evaluate investment opportunities, optimize portfolios, and mitigate risks.

The X-factor in Betterment comes from the use of Big data technology as part of the algorithm. The machine learning algorithm employed has a reservoir of data to train itself with and optimize the process better. That makes the algorithm in use by Betterment adept at analyzing the customer&#39;s profile and recommending and implementing a tailored investment strategy. It also plays an important and central role in understanding external variables that affects the direction of investment and financial related wind. When it comes to the use and analysis of alternative datasets, these technologies become second to none. The principle of know-your customer model is a must have in the current financial market. The algorithm is built around that principle. The implementation of the three advances in technology puts the company at a better competitive advantage than the traditional wealth management institutions.

## Landscape:

The advent of interconnected world and the emergence of internet of things facilitated the conditions for the emergence of online investment advisory platforms. The ease of that the networked world provided together with the new generation of investment clients who think differently about advisory services posed new expectations and demands to the wealth management business that was sitting in indifference to the changes. The new generation expectation is set by tech giants that provide digital service together with high connectivity.

Fueled by technological affinity and the dependence of the new generation in digital content, highly innovative and digitally enabled fintech companies emerged. These fintech companies and financial service platforms assimilated the advances in technology, especially in the areas of electrical/electronic and software. The technologies at the center of these transformations are Big data, robust machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence. The change in the customer needs will be more pronounced by the realization of newer technologies such as 5G.

In light of the technological advancements and the change in client needs, robo advisors came to surface and started to change and challenge the traditional playing field. The world robo-advisory market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 53.54% from 2020 to 2025. This growth trend in the market is expected to hold for a foreseeable future. wealth management industry has long been resilient to the digitization process observed in the wider financial services space.

Betterment is one of the pioneer and major market player in the field of robo-advisory service. The major competitors in the field are: FutureAdvisor, Personal Capital, Vanguard Personal Advisor, Wealthfront, WiseBanyan, SigFid Wealth management.

## Results

The main reason for choosing robo is the combination of ease, cost, and near-index returns. Traditional companies are forced to adopt technological tools to help advisors focus on other aspects of the advisory service than dealing with labor intensive data crunching and analysis. These traditional service providers are also forced to consider and reconsider the high service fees that they used to incur to stay relevant in the market. The emergence of robo-advisory platforms has disrupted the traditional ways the market and made investment accessible to everyday user. Betterment is able to attract about 500,000 customers and counting. It is a major player in the market. It is working on refining the process and make it more customer focused. Understanding the customer need, the generation inclination, the technological trend and the overall market climate should be at the core of the business model.

The customer main concern is to grow the value of their money in measurable ways. How do betterment continually measure the value added to the customers in the services and recommendations provided?

- Measuring What Matters: by simulating Many Possible Futures, instead of a Naïve Forecast using Monte-Carlo Simulation
- Use the asset-class level expected returns associated with the hypothetical benchmark funds and funds in Betterment&#39;s portfolios, measure any differences attributable to asset allocation.
- Look at performance net of expenses, using the SPIVA costs provided by S&amp;P in the mid-year report and adding the expenses associated with the Betterment portfolio. This set of assumptions will help the company measure the added benefit of Betterment&#39;s fund selections, which typically have lower expenses and more closely track the relevant benchmark.
- Use rebalancing methodology that aims to limit tax consequences by using customers cash-flow, and it also uses drift-based rebalancing, aiming to keep the allocation within 3% of the target weights. Betterment rebalancing approach also refrains from causing short-term gains, as these are particularly tax inefficient.
- Simulating Uncertain Future Markets and Investors Over Time to Understand Betterment&#39;s Value

Betterment LLC was selected out of hundreds to be a part of the 2020 Forbes Fintech 50 based upon self-submission of a form providing the most basic firm details and research conducted by Forbes reporters and editors. Forbes readerships were also allowed to submit company nominations. Among other factors, this ranking was based on the following criteria: 1) Strong growth over the past year and at a faster pace than competitors; 2) Have a publicly live, working product; 3) Have significant U.S. operation.

## Recommendations

As new competitors are coming into play and the advances in technology is rapidly progressing, I would recommend Betterment to look closer into the service/management fees and find ways to further slice it down to attract more customers and have the edge over competitors.

To that end keeping up to date with the technological advancement and customizing the tech to their goal becomes essential. Advancements in neural network and artificial intelligence will have significant impact in staying in control in the playing field.
